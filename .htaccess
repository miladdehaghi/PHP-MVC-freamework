# Enable the rewrite engine for URL rewriting
RewriteEngine On

# If the URL is empty (i.e., the root URL), rewrite it to the 'public' folder
# ^$ - Matches an empty string (the root URL, like 'example.com/')
# [L] - This is the "Last" rule; no further rules will be processed if this one matches
RewriteRule ^$ public/ [L]

# For any other request, rewrite it to the 'public' folder, maintaining the original path
# (.*) - Matches any URL path (anything after the domain)
# public/$1 - Rewrites the path to the 'public' folder, appending the original path ($1 refers to whatever was captured by (.*))
# [L] - Again, stops further processing if this rule matches
RewriteRule (.*) public/$1 [L]
